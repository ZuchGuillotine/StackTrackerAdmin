## RESOLVED: Blog Editor Data Loading Issue

### Issue Description (RESOLVED)
We were experiencing an issue with the blog editor component where existing blog post data was not populating in the editor form fields when a user attempted to edit a post. Despite the correct post ID being present in the URL and the data being successfully fetched on the server side, the form fields remained empty.

### Root Cause
The issue was identified as a parameter handling problem. Specifically:
1. The wouter router's `useParams()` hook wasn't correctly extracting the URL parameters in our implementation
2. The route parameters object was empty despite the URL containing the correct post ID
3. This prevented the data fetching mechanism from using the correct ID to load the post data

### Solution Implemented
We implemented the following fixes:

1. **Direct URL Parameter Extraction**: 
   ```typescript
   // Get ID directly from URL since params weren't working
   const [location] = useLocation();
   const urlParts = location.split('/');
   const id = urlParts[urlParts.length - 1];
   ```
   
2. **Simplified Component Definition**:
   ```typescript
   // Changed from
   <ProtectedRoute path="/blog-editor/:id" component={(params) => <BlogEditor key={params.id} />} />
   
   // To
   <ProtectedRoute path="/blog-editor/:id" component={() => <BlogEditor />} />
   ```

3. **Improved Logging and Debugging**:
   - Added comprehensive debug information display
   - Created a RouteDebug component for checking route parameters
   - Implemented detailed console logging to trace the problem

### Verification
The fix was successfully tested with multiple blog posts. The editor now:
- Correctly extracts the post ID from the URL
- Successfully fetches post data using this ID
- Properly populates all form fields (title, excerpt, thumbnail URL, and content)
- Successfully saves updates back to the server

### Key Findings & Lessons
1. **Routing Parameter Handling**: When faced with routing parameter issues, direct URL parsing can be a reliable fallback mechanism
2. **Component Rendering**: The `key` prop in the route definition was causing unexpected re-renders
3. **Wouter Router Behavior**: The wouter router's parameter handling behaves differently from some other routers, requiring a different approach
4. **Debugging Strategy**: Having a dedicated debug component was crucial for identifying the issue

## Current Status

### Phase 1: Core Setup (COMPLETED)
- âœ… Environment Configuration
- âœ… CORS Setup
- âœ… Authentication Implementation
- âœ… Database Connection

### Phase 2: Feature Implementation (IN PROGRESS)
1. Blog Management
   - âœ… CRUD Operations
   - âœ… Rich Text Editor (TinyMCE integration)
   - âœ… Blog Editor Form
   - [ ] Media Management
   - [ ] SEO Tools

2. Supplement Reference Management (Not Started)
   - [ ] CRUD Operations
   - [ ] Batch Operations
   - [ ] Version Control
   - [ ] Scientific References

3. User Management (Not Started)
   - [ ] Role Management
   - [ ] Access Control
   - [ ] Activity Monitoring

4. Analytics Dashboard (Not Started)
   - [ ] Performance Metrics
   - [ ] Health Monitoring
   - [ ] Export Features

### Security Requirements (Partially Complete)
âœ… Completed:
- JWT-based authentication
- HTTP-only cookies

ðŸ”„ Pending:
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] IP whitelisting
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Regular security scans
- [ ] Automated backups

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Implement CSRF protection and rate limiting
2. Complete Blog Management features (Media Management & SEO Tools)
3. Set up User Management features
4. Implement audit logging
5. Develop Supplement Reference Management
6. Create Analytics Dashboard
7. Set up automated security scans and backups

## Performance Optimization Tasks
- [ ] Implement data caching
- [ ] Configure database connection pooling
- [ ] Set up request queue management
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring

## Notes for Collaborators
- The project uses a shared NeonDB instance with the main application
- Authentication is handled through JWT tokens
- Development follows the professional variant theme as defined in theme.json
- UI components are built using a component library with Tailwind CSS
- Blog editor uses TinyMCE for rich text editing with toggle between visual and HTML modes
- TinyMCE API key is stored in environment variables as TINY_MCE_KEY
- Remember to add Replit development URLs (*.replit.dev or *.spock.replit.dev) to the approved domains in TinyMCE dashboard

### Recent Code Improvements
1. **URL Parameter Handling**: 
   - The blog editor now reliably extracts post IDs directly from the URL path
   - This method is more robust than depending on the router's param extraction

2. **Route Definition Enhancement**:
   - Simplified component rendering in routes to prevent re-render issues
   - Removed unnecessary key props that were causing unexpected behavior

3. **Debugging Tools**:
   - Added a RouteDebug component for diagnosing routing issues
   - Implemented extensive console logging for parameter and data flow tracking

4. **Form Field Population**:
   - Fixed form field population by ensuring the post data properly flows to the state variables
   - TinyMCE editor now correctly receives and displays post content

5. **Data Fetching**:
   - Added proper cache prevention in fetch calls to ensure fresh data
   - Improved error handling in API requests
