## Current Troubleshooting: Blog Editor Data Loading Issue

### Issue Description
We're experiencing an issue with the blog editor component where existing blog post data is not populating in the editor form fields when a user attempts to edit a post. While blog posts are successfully being created and listed in the blog management page, when selecting a post to edit, the editor fields remain empty despite the correct post ID being present in the URL.

### Troubleshooting Steps Taken

1. **Initial Investigation**:
   - Confirmed that blog posts are being created successfully
   - Verified that blog management page displays posts correctly
   - Confirmed that the URL shows the correct post ID when navigating to edit a post

2. **Code Modifications**:
   - Modified the fetch request in blog-editor.tsx to include proper method and cache settings
   - Updated the useEffect hooks to better handle post data initialization
   - Improved TinyMCE editor initialization to properly set content from post data
   - Fixed the update post mutation to include the post ID in the data payload

3. **Issues Found**:
   - The data fetching mechanism appeared correct but the form fields weren't being populated
   - The TinyMCE editor wasn't consistently receiving content from the post data
   - There may be timing issues with when post data is available vs. when the editor initializes

4. **Current Status**:
   - Blog post creation works correctly
   - Blog management page displays posts with correct titles
   - The editor URL shows the correct post ID when navigating to edit
   - Post data is still not displaying in the editor form fields

### Next Steps for Collaborators
1. Verify the server-side API endpoint for fetching a single post by ID
2. Add additional logging in the fetch request and response handling
3. Consider implementing a loading state that prevents the editor from rendering until data is fully loaded
4. Verify that the post data structure returned by the API matches what the editor component expects
