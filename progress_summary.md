- Set up image uploading for blog thumbnails
- Created blog listing and detail views

### Research Documents
- Added research document management system
- Implemented CRUD operations for research documents
- Set up categorization and search functionality

### Supplement References
- Implemented supplement reference database schema with name and category fields
- Created API endpoints for CRUD operations:
  - GET /api/admin/supplements - Retrieve all supplement references
  - GET /api/admin/supplements/:id - Retrieve a specific supplement reference
  - POST /api/admin/supplements - Create a new supplement reference
  - PUT /api/admin/supplements/:id - Update an existing supplement reference
  - DELETE /api/admin/supplements/:id - Delete a supplement reference
- Built reference management UI interface with the following features:
  - Display supplement references in a table with name and category
  - Form for adding and editing supplement references
  - Delete confirmation dialog
  - Real-time updating of the reference list using React Query

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend
- Express.js API routes with authentication middleware
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- Schema definitions using Drizzle for type safety
- Storage layer implementing repository pattern

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- React Query for data fetching and mutations
- Shadcn UI components for consistent design
- Form validation using Zod and React Hook Form

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Routes handle HTTP requests and responses
   - Storage layer handles database operations
   - Schema defines data structure

2. **Type Safety**:
   - TypeScript interfaces for all data models
   - Zod validation for form inputs

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Consistent error responses from API
   - Client-side error handling with toast notifications

4. **Performance**:
   - Query invalidation to ensure data freshness
   - Optimistic updates for responsive UI

5. **User Experience**:
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
   - Loading states during data fetching
   - Toast notifications for action feedback

## Lessons Learned
- Importance of proper error handling in full-stack applications
- Benefits of using React Query for managing server state
- Value of consistent API response patterns
- Significance of thorough syntax checking before deployment

## Next Steps
- Implement search and filtering for reference management
- Add pagination for large datasets
- Enhance UI with additional sorting options
- Add data visualization for supplement reference statistics
